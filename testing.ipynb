Give me your best guess. look at the examples in the FAISS database. Do you understand the question? If not, what additional information do you need.\", 'result': \"Given the 4x4 Sudoku puzzle:\\n\\n```\\n[[0, 0, 0, 1],\\n[0, 1, 0, 0],\\n[0, 2, 0, 0],\\n[0, 4, 2, 0]]\\n```\\n\\nLet's solve it step by step while respecting the rule that each row, column, and 2x2 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 through 4 without repetition.\\n\\n1. Start with the last column since it has the number 1 in the first row. We need to place 2, 3, and 4 in the remaining rows in some order. But since there's already a 2 in the third row, the last column must be `[1, 3, 4, 2]` from top to bottom.\\n\\n2. Now we have:\\n\\n```\\n[[0, 0, 0, 1],\\n[0, 1, 0, 3],\\n[0, 2, 0, 4],\\n[0, 4, 2, 2]]\\n```\\n\\n3. In the second row, we have the numbers 1 and 3. We need to place 2 and 4. Since 4 cannot be in the last column (it's already there in the third row), the second row must be `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.\\n\\n4. We now have:\\n\\n```\\n[[0, 0, 0, 1],\\n[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n[0, 2, 0, 4],\\n[0, 4, 2, 2]]\\n```\\n\\n5. In the third column, we see that 2 is already in the fourth row, so we need to place the numbers 1 and 3 in the first and third rows. Given that the second row of the third column is 2, and the fourth row cannot be 3 (since it's already in the second row of the fourth column), the third column must be `[3, 2, 1, 2]`.\\n\\n6. Now we have:\\n\\n```\\n[[0, 0, 3, 1],\\n[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n[0, 2, 1, 4],\\n[0, 4, 2, 2]]\\n```\\n\\n7. In the first row, 3 is already in the third column and 1 is in the last column, so we need to place 2 and 4. Since 4 is already in the second row of the first column, the first row must be `[2, 4, 3, 1]`.\\n\\n8. The puzzle now looks like this:\\n\\n```\\n[[2, 4, 3, 1],\\n[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n[0, 2, 1, 4],\\n[0, 4, 2, 2]]\\n```\\n\\n9. In the first column, we can see that 2 and 4 are already used in the first and second rows, so we need to place 1 and 3 in the third and fourth rows. The third row can only have 3 because there's a 1 in the third column, and the fourth row therefore must have 1.\\n\\n10. Completing the puzzle:\\n\\n```\\n[[2, 4, 3, 1],\\n[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n[3, 2, 1, 4],\\n[1, 4, 2, 2]]\\n```\\n\\nHowever, there's a mistake here, as the number 2 is repeated in the fourth column. We must correct the last two rows:\\n\\n```\\n[[2, 4, 3, 1],\\n[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n[3, 2, 4, 4],\\n[1, 3, 1, 2]]\\n```\\n\\nAgain, there's a clear mistake as the number 4 and the number 1 are repeated.
